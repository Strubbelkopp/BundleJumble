# About
This mod was inspired by the video ['The Potential of Bundles and Archaeology'](https://youtu.be/MykT4bMUVRg) from Minecraft Ideas Academy.
It gives you the ability to place random blocks from inside your bundle, which makes it a nice building tool.
Now you can also dye your bundle using the same system leather armor uses, so you can tell them easier apart. Lastly I've made some other quality of life changes relating to the bundle as well, which are specified under 'Features'.

## Features
- Right-clicking with a bundle will place a random block from the bundle
- Throwing out all items now requires holding shift
- If your bundle runs out of a block, it checks your inventory if you have more of that item and automatically refills your bundle
- If that's not the case, you'll get a message saying, you've run out of that block
- Bundle can now be dyed with near infinite colour combinations using the vanilla colouring system
- Adds a recipe for the bundle, using either leather or rabbit hide
- Rabbits now have the possibility to get up to 3 babies when breeding them, making it easier to get rabbit hide (You monster!)
- Readded the bundle to the creative inventory under 'Tools'
